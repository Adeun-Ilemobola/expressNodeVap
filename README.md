## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ User Authentication & Sessions
- Users log in via browser sessions.
- The session maintains authentication and persists user state.

### 2️⃣ Folder Creation
- Users create a new folder.
- This triggers:
    - A **MongoDB update** with folder details.
    - Instant UI reflection.

### 3️⃣ Note Creation
- Users create new notes (inside a folder or standalone).
- This triggers:
    - A **MongoDB update** storing the note data.
    - UI refresh to display the new note.

### 4️⃣ Note Modification
- Users edit note titles, content, or metadata.
- The system:
    - Updates the **MongoDB database** immediately.
    - Reflects changes in real-time.

### 5️⃣ User Information Management
- Users update personal details (e.g., name, password).
- This triggers:
    - An **immediate database update**.
    - Updates to stored session credentials.

### 6️⃣ Real-Time Synchronization
- All changes (**folders, notes, user info**) are pushed to the database instantly.
- The UI auto-refreshes to ensure data accuracy.

### 7️⃣ Session Handling
- **Active session** → Users can manage folders, notes, and profiles.
- **Session expiration/logout** → Secure logout procedures are triggered.
